This weekend, I was able to make gentle progress on the website by adding my resume, as well as finding documentation on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  I hope to be able to make more progress as the week continues by providing updates on what I have been doing at work as well as my hobbies.  I also hope to add a project to the site before the end of the week.


#### Goals

- [ ] Create a couple posts about my life in all aspects (work, projects, hobbies).  I will attempt one of each at least
- [x] Update the resume section to have my information
- [ ] Understand and configure all aspects of CI/CD pipeline created by the jekyll template
- [ ] Create a functional spec of my first personal project and at it to the projects section
- [x] Get the hang of markdown formatting principles to make post creation much smoother, or find an alternative way to create markdown files that is more intuitive
