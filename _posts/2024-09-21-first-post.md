I am so excited! I am making my first blog post on this personal [website](https://kghalamb.github.io/)

I want to list some of the goals that I have set for this first week of making this site


#### Goals

- Create a couple posts about my life in all aspects (work, projects, hobbies).  I will attempt one of each at least
- Update the resume section to have my information
- Understand and configure all aspects of CI/CD pipeline created by the jekyll template
- Create a functional spec of my first personal project and at it to the projects section
- Get the hang of markdown formatting principles to make post creation much smoother, or find an alternative way to create markdown files that is more intuitive
