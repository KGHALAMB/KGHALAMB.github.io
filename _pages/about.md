Hello! My name is Kaveh Ghalambor, and I am a newgrad software engineer living in the Bay Area.  My current interests are related to systems engineering, software development, and cloud solutions.  I have recently begun working at Extreme Networks as a Software Systems Engineer for their NMS org and I am super excited to learn more about the industry.  I also enjoy keeping track of new emerging technologies in the field like AI/ML, NLP, and robotics.  It is my goal to eventually become an expert in all of my topics of interest and I want to achieve that goal through hard work and the support of my peers.  This website will track all of my personal projects as well as achievements.

In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar and singing, kickboxing, watching scary movies, and spending time with friends and family.  I hope to keep updates on the fun activities through this platform as well!

This website is a work in progress!
